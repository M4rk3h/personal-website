# Welcome to my personal website!

This is a repo which I neglected for a few years but wanted to update my website after finishing my masters degree. This is a _very basic_ VC of sorts without all the technical stuff.

This website is intentionally basic and used [Bootstrap](!https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) which is amazing to use and can really help quickly create a website.

__Thanks for your time.__
