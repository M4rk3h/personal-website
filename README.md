# Welcome to my personal website!

This is a repository I revived after completing my master's degree. It's a basic version of my website, stripped of technical details.

This website intentionally keeps things simple and utilizes Bootstrap, a popular framework for quickly creating websites.

## Features and Technologies

* Built with Bootstrap for a sleek and responsive design
* Minimalistic approach to showcase personal projects and experiences

__Thanks for visiting my website.__
