    <p>
      I've been into technology for a long time, starting as an IT practitioner which I got into due to solving broken
      things.
      I also enjoy playing guitar and writing music, playing with desktop linux, weird David Lynch films and playing
      video games.

        <h3>MSc Data Science</h3>
        <p> During my masters, first of all it was all done remotely due to a global pandemic - whilst this doesn't
          sound too bad it did require me to upgrade my custom built PC.</p>
        <p> During the course, I covered a range of subjects which are as follows: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Applied Statistics for Data Science </li>
          <li> Data Mining and Statistical Forecasting </li>
          <li> Project Management and Research Methodology </li>
          <li> Principles Of Computing </li>
          <li> Applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning </li>
          <li> Data Engineering and Applications </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Whilst finishing off the MSc by carrying out a dissertation project with NHS Wales: Delivery Unit. This
          project is titled 'Predictive Modelling of Demand and Capacity in General Practice (GP) And Primary Care'.</p>
        <p> During the dissertation I was tasked to explore open-source datasets and carry out some analysis using the R
          programing language.</p>
